Busy-Days

A web app for creating and managing custom business work schedules!

 Register an account to use the service!
 Create business specific schedules by configuring all relevant information:
   - Open times
   - Job role hierarchy 
   - Business regular events, calendar events and employee holiday 
   - Employee roster with all relevant employee data:
       * Availability 
       * Days off
     
  Then go to the schedule page to create a weekly schdule.
  As you add shifts the scheduler will alert for errors in staff availability or business requirements and give a general score of the schedule.

  Automatic scheduling is also a potential future function!
